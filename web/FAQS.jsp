In this technique, the bumps on the “F” and “J” keys serve as a reference so that the keys can be found without the individual having to look at the keyboard. In the initial typing position, the four fingers of each hand are positioned on the central line of the keyboard and operate the other keys from that position, while the thumbs operate the space key.
            This is one of the main techniques used for typing and is taught in many institutions and typing courses.</p>
